SKIPFISH

skipfish is an active web application security             reconnaissance tool.It prepares an interactive sitemap for     the targeted site by carrying out a recursive crawl and       dictionary-based probes. The resulting map is then         annotated with the output from a number of active (but      hopefully non-disruptive) security checks. The fi‐ nal report generated by the tool is meant to serve as a foundation for professional web application secu‐ rityassessments.

Skipfishperforms recursive crawl and dictionary-based tests over all URLs, using its recon capabilities. The crawl creates a digital map of security checks and their results.

- Noteworthy Skipfishfeatures include:
- Automated learning capabilities.
- Differential security checks.
- Easy to use.
- A low false positive ratio.
- The ability to run high-speed security checks, with over 200 requests per second.
