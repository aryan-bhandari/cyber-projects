## Title: Encryption and Decryption using Random Variables
 
## Description:

This C++ code implements a simple encryption and decryption algorithm using random variables. The code is designed to be run on the Visual Studio Code platform using the MinGW library for C++.

The code utilizes the following headers:

#include <iostream>: This header is used for input and output operations.
#include <string>: This header is used for string operations.
The encryption process involves assigning random variables to each character in the plaintext. The encrypted text is generated by replacing each character in the plaintext with its corresponding random variable.

The decryption process involves reversing the encryption process using a decryption function provided in the code. This function takes the encrypted text and decrypts it back to its original plaintext using the assigned random variables.

The encryption and decryption functions are implemented within the code, allowing for seamless transformation between plaintext and encrypted text.

To run the code, ensure that Visual Studio Code is set up with the MinGW library for C++ and compile the C++ file containing the code. Once compiled, execute the compiled file to perform encryption and decryption operations.
link to install vs code for any os = https://code.visualstudio.com/download
link to install mingw = https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

after installing the mingw copy C:\MinGW\bin which is the default path given to mingw during installation then go to environment variable then go to system variable inside system variable go to path then paste this C:\MinGW\bin path their then click ok in all then you are good to go to run this code
